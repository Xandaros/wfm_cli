A command-line tool that screenshots the relic reward screen, and select the best reward, based on warframe.market platinum prices.

## Platform support
- Linux - Has been tested on Linux with X11 and GNOME, but it should also work on other desktop enviroments.
- MacOS - Hasn't been tested, probabbly works.
- Windows - Fails to compile due to screenshot library not supporting windows.
